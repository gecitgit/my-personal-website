            <p>My name is Taulant Ismailgeci and I am currently a Software Engineering student at the Flatiron School bootcamp.  I left behind my career in education in pursuit of new challenges with the hope of one day returning to education.  I saw so many problems come up during my time at work that felt like they had simple solutions, but there were no built-in systems to address it.  The one memory that has stuck with me over the past few years was the family that wanted to have a system where the stories their child was reading could be automatically color-coded for punctuation and certain grammar rules. Using the tools we had at hand, the best we could do was manually typing up the stories and applying the appropriate color-coding.  I grew frustrated that the concept seemed so simple and while I could perfectly visualize it in my mind, I lacked the technical tools to make it come to life.</p>
            <p>Please take a moment to look around my website. I'd love to hear what you think about it! The website features some of the basic CS, HTML and JS that is covered in the boot camp prework course.  My curiosity grew and I spent a while researching different concepts and tried to implement them on the different pages of my site. Upon my completion of the course I will make a new portfolio to mark my growth. I'm looking forward to what this journey has in store for me.</p>
